Why did the developer quit his job?  
*Because he didn't get arrays*  

Hello, I am a full-stack junior developer with a passion for front end, ready to disrupt the tech world and change the face of development.

A strong background in Biomedical science and neurology has lead me through a rocky spell at a med comms company, across the Atlantic, into a start-up and finally into the world of Tech.  

Having completed [Makers Academy](http://makersacademy.com), Europe's leading Web Developer bootcamp, I have been exploring the world of programming, its endless learning curves and its unlimited potential.


## SKILLS

**Curious :cat:**  
*"I am neither clever nor especially gifted, I am only very, very Curious"* - Albert Einstein  
My background in biomedicine has given me a passion for discovery: It has taught me to find patterns, and then challenge them. Curiosity and my drive to find out new things has also allowed me to stay focused, leading me down the rabbit hole of new languages, clean code, and agile approaches.

**Creative :bulb:**  
Creativity is the pod to Technologies pea. Without creativity, technology would be stuck in the stone ages. My creative flair allows me to think outside the box and to take advantage of my scientific and logical side, in a different way.

**Great Pear :pear:**  
I am a huge believer in team-work and the importance of getting on well as a community, whether that means being there for your pair on a bad day of JavaScript or keeping upbeat when team moral is low.

[GracePrince](https://www.graceprince.com/index)| Grace Prince, a fresh young carpenter from London came to me with a unique challenge; she wanted a website to reflect her quirky side, whilst still showing her collection in a professional way. Together we worked towards an individual solution involving GSAP animations, allowing me to further explore jquery and javascript, whilst fine-tuning my css and html skills.
