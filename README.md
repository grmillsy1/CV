Why did the developer quit his job?  
*Because he didn't get arrays*  

Hello, I am a 'Full-Stack' Junior Developer, Scrum Master and Neuroscience enthusiast with a background in science and a passion for exciting new technology.

Being an unusual blend of logical and creative, I love working on every aspect of a project; from conceptualization, prototyping and design, right through to testing, development and launch.

Since learning to code at [Makers Academy](http://makersacademy.com), Europe's leading Web Developer bootcamp, I have been exploring the world of both front-end and back-end programming in a number of languages, discovering its endless learning curves and unlimited potential. I had a great time as a Junior Developer at my last job at [AND Digital](https://and.digital/), upskilling further in React/Redux and AngularJS. I also took on the Scrum Master role at our largest client, coaching members of the team in agile methodologies.

## SKILLS

**Inquisitive :cat:**  
*"I am neither clever nor especially gifted, I am only very, very Curious"* - Albert Einstein  
My background in biomedicine has given me a passion for discovery: It has taught me to find patterns, and then challenge them, an attribute that lends itself well to programming. Curiosity and my drive to find out new things has also kept me focused on exploring new languages and frameworks, following X-P values, keeping clean code, and agile methodologies.

**Creative :bulb:**  
Creativity is the pod to technologies pea, allowing the world of tech to develop and grow in exciting new ways. My creative flair allows me to think outside the box and to take advantage of my scientific and logical side in a different way. This is key in coding as finding solutions to difficult problems is all part of the fun!

**Great Pear :pear:**  
I am a huge believer in team-work and the importance of getting on well as a community, whether that means being there for your pair on a bad day of JavaScript or keeping upbeat when team moral is low. I enjoy pair programming, supporting and learning from each other to keep improving as a developer.

[GracePrince](https://www.graceprince.com/index)| Grace Prince, a fresh young carpenter from London came to me with a unique challenge; she wanted a website to reflect her quirky side, whilst still showing her collection in a professional way. Together we worked towards an individual solution involving GSAP animations, allowing me to further explore jQuery and JavaScript, whilst fine-tuning my CSS and HTML skills.
