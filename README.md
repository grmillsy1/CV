Why did the developer quit his job?  
*Because he didn't get arrays*  

Hello, I am a full-stack junior developer with a passion for front end, ready to disrupt the tech world and change the face of development.

A strong background in Biomedical science and neurology has lead me through a rocky spell at a med comms company, across the Atlantic, into a start-up and finally into the world of Tech.  

Having completed [Makers Academy](http://makersacademy.com), Europe's leading Web Developer bootcamp, I have been exploring the world of programming, its endless learning curves and its unlimited potential.


## SKILLS

**Curious :cat:**  
*"I am neither clever nor especially gifted, I am only very, very Curious"* - Albert Einstein  
My background in biomedicine has fine-tuned my curious gene, which has also been at the forefront in my drive to learn new things and expand my mind.  
Curiosity has allowed me to stay focused, leading me down the rabbit hole of new languages, clean code, and agile approaches.

**Creative :bulb:**  
Creativity is the pod to Technologies pea. Without creativity, tech would be stuck in the stone ages.
My own personal creative flair allows me to think outside the box and use my scientific, logical brain in a way that can be quite unique.

**Great Pear :pear:**  
I am a huge believer in team-work and the importance of getting on well as a community, whether that means being there for your pair on a bad day of JavaScript, keeping upbeat when team moral is low, or standing up to sing a christmas song in-front of your whole company.

Our small team of junior developers learnt swift from scratch, implemented agile development and TDD to complete our working MVP in just 8 days.

[My Blog]() | After graduating from Makers Academy, I decided to expand my knowledge base and have a go at React.
